## ver 3.0.0 [2022-06-18]

In this brand new version, I have simplified the project. Specifically, going forward the project will focus on visual chart generation and remove the rendering to video part.

I found a new library called [Remotion](https://www.remotion.dev/), which is dedicated to rendering browser elements and animations into videos. It is recommended that you use this library to render the charts generated by anichart.

I have also created a plugin to easily use anichart for remotion for data visualization creation.

In addition, I have used Vitepress to create a new document that includes a manual of options for charts, and a tutorial on using anichart to create charts and render videos.

**What's Changed**

- Remove all render modules.
- Remove dependencies that are no longer needed.
- Optimized package size.
- Fixed the map without data background. A striped background is now displayed by default when there is no data.
- Added a new Canvas Helper to generate patterns from images.

**Docs**

- New documentation online
- Added options manual
- Added a tutorial on using anichart in remotion.
- Updated the readme for the project.
